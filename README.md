# SystemTrayAnimator

</div>

SystemTrayAnimator creates animation from your directory with image files in the System Tray area. Just copy your images to the directory and SystemTrayAnimator will animate them at a given speed. This is not only beautiful, but also convenient to inform you about the start or completion of some long process (for example, copying large files, etc.). As a directory, you can specify a network drive or folder, then the images for animation can be copied remotely over the network.
